✅ No autoplay at start!

✅ Space bar = Pause/play

Bakcspace = ✅ reverts to 0.00 (or the start of a loop sequence - explained below)

✅ Arrows scroll words 1 at a time - it works as a "stop" button if sequence is in play.

ALT + arrows scrolls to the nearest full stop depending on your direction - if there are no full stops because of bad grammer, it jumps 10 words.

✅ Holding down arrows scrolls through the words.

A button with (T) in the top left corner - it expands the Text box - screen becomes one half text box, one half the speed reading page - like opening a window and closing it.

In side the text box, there is a L button - when you click it, you can highlight the text you want LOOPED - you can save it as a loop and you can have up to 9 saves -  when you go back to the speed reading page, pressing those numbers on the keyboard will play the designated text within that save as a loop, but you have to press play to start that loop. 

Ghosts words are the words that aren't the Podium word - an option to side the ghost words.

An option to decide if the ghost words scroll up, down, or left (like normal reading)

An option to have all the words in the text box randomly placed on the screen around the podium word at the centre, and when it becomes the podium word it dissapears from the backdrop and eventually the page is no longer full of words - or maybe you start with no words and end up with a backdrop of all the words you read. xD

If a word has a hyphen like "counter-productive" it is displayed 2x longer due to it being two words.

The podium word plays a ticking sound like a dial on a vault at the same rate the words are displayed.

✅ Pressing up or down slows or speed up the word-rate by 25 wps

Maybe the option to rate words speed based on their size... # of letters = play speed - but the base rate is set at 5 letters.. so selecting 600wps would mean 5 and below play at 600wps, and anything with more letters is slowed down relative to the number of letters it has - maybe -5% speed for every letter beyond 5?

✅ A time thingy to let you know how long it will take to read at x speed or how long you've got.

With the dial sound, maybe a little 'ping' noise for every hundred words.

If the text box is open, the display screen is the other half - if you click on the display screen and start it, you see the words on the left highlighed in the text box.

There should be a fireworks/celeration display when you finish everything there is to play xD because why not.

If there is a "hello" the " is displayed with the word, but if it is like "Hello, Mr World. I want to eat your jello." then " is displayed on the left and the right of the words displayed without moving with a little space, until the quotes is finished. Maybe this should be the same for ( ).
